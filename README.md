**Making a Knowledge Fight Discord bot**

The bot is up and runnning! It's on an EC2 instance so shouldn't be going down anytime soon but please raise an issue if it is. It's making calls to an API, there's no data kept on this repo.

The back-end search engine is currently being updated manually so if you find that recent episodes are missing, I promise I will get to them soon. Please feel free to raise an issue if it's been a while.
